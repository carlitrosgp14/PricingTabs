# PricingTabs
 Tab Switching UI Component – JavaScript DOM Manipulation.
 
This project showcases a reusable tab-switching interface built using vanilla JavaScript, focused on DOM manipulation, event delegation, and component-based logic design.  

# Project Context
As part of a freelance engagement, I was tasked with building an interactive pricing section that allows users to switch between different subscription plans (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise). The goal was to provide a clean and responsive user interface that reflects plan details when the corresponding tab is selected.

Rather than relying on external libraries or frameworks, I intentionally built this from scratch using vanilla JavaScript to reinforce my understanding of:

- Dynamic DOM selection
  
- Event handling & listeners
  
- Function abstraction and reusability
  
- Arrow functions and modern ES6+ syntax
  
- Class toggling for UI state control
  
- Progressive enhancement principles

# What I Reinforced in My Learning Journey
This project helped me deepen my grasp on:

- Structuring JavaScript logic in a way that's modular, readable, and scalable
 
- Creating declarative, DRY functions instead of repetitive code blocks
  
- Using template literals and data-* attributes to create dynamic and maintainable selectors
  
- Making UI features accessible and responsive with minimal code

# Keywords for Technical Reviewers
If you're a hiring manager, tech lead, or someone reviewing this repo, here's what you'll find reinforced in this project:

✅ DOM API mastery

✅ Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

✅ Clean code practices & modular design

✅ UI/UX logic implementation

✅ Event delegation & listener optimization

✅ Client-oriented problem solving

✅ Real-world application of JavaScript fundamentals in freelance work

# Who Is This For?
Whether you're another developer trying to understand how to create interactive UI components with plain JavaScript, or a potential employer reviewing my frontend capabilities, I hope this example reflects my attention to code clarity, problem-solving approach, and growing expertise in software development.
